# lucene-in-action
Lucene in action source code

The code is wrapped into an easy to play java maven project.
There could be some additions for playing with lucene behind the book's code(those will be tagged somehow).

Also keep in mind that the project is written in 2015 using the latest available lucene version - 5.2.1
so not be surprised with the new versions stuff (this project is not indetened to be 100% copy of original one)
